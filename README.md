# Neural-Networks-for-Basketball-Substitution-Prediction
The code for my Rouse award essay and research. This repo was initially on my main github account "1paleking1" but has been migrated to a more profesional email. Archived code is not included in this repo. All code including archived code can be found in the "Rouse" repo on 1paleking1's (me) account.

All data was obtained from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ and webscraped by me.
