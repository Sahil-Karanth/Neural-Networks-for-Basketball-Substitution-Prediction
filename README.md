# Neural-Networks-for-Basketball-Substitution-Prediction
The code for my Rouse award essay and research. This repo was initially on my main github account "1paleking1" but has been migrated to a more profesional email. I then decided to rename my main github account so transferred this repo back here.

All data was obtained from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ and webscraped by me.
